    // Let's say we have an array --> THESE ARE PASSED BY REFERENCE
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    team[3] = 'Lux'; // this changes BOTH!!

    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    console.log(players, team);

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way
    const players2 = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    const team2 = players2.slice(); // returns a copy of the array so original remains untouched
    console.log(players2, team2);
    team2[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(players2, team2);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    const team3 = [].concat(players3); 
    console.log(players3, team3);

    const players4 = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    const team4 = [...players4]
    console.log(players4, team4);
    team4[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(players4, team4);

     // or create a new array from the old one
    const players5 = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    const team5 = Array.from(players5);
    console.log(players5, team5);
    team5[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(players5, team5);
    
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Jeremy Myers',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;
    console.log(person, captain);

    // how do we take a copy instead? Use object assign
    const person2 = {

    };
    const captain2 = person2;
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person2, {age: 99});
    console.log(captain2, cap2);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const jd = Object.assign({},jeremy, {age:420}); // this works to reassign FIRST LEVEL properties only
    console.log(jd);

    jd.social.twitter = '@jdmyers_dev'; // this is a second level property, and it also gets changed on jeremy
    console.log(jeremy, jd);

    // there is a fancy javascript function called clone deep that allows this... but very rarely do you really have to fully clone an object
